# fight-or-nofight
Show if people are fighting or not in CCTV footage

* Purpose is to show my progress in Machine Learning and OpenCV. I am using this as a way to continue learning and store my progress.

## Predicting Fight or No Fight in CCTV Footage

![](fight-or-nofight.gif)


## Description
* Project uses VIRAT-footage dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network to be able to recognize the difference between people fighting and not. The dataset contains environments that are pretty sparsed as a way to prevent bias. However, the accuracy of being able to classifying fights fails at times, which can be noted to the fact that the training set is pretty poor. 
* I built this project so that I can recognize holes in my learning.

## Things I want to add
* I want to continue looking at the probability output to tweak when the model should print fight-or-nofight to prevent the flickering between the tags at times.
